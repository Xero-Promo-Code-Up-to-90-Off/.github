You're not alone if your code gets rejected. Common issues include:

- **Expired code**: Most codes have a short shelf life.
- **New users only**: Many offers are valid only for first-time customers.
- **Region-locked**: Some codes work only in select countries.

Before trying another code, double-check eligibility or switch to incognito mode for a clean attempt.
